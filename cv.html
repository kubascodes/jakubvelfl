							<h2 class="">2018 Data Warehouse Analyst (7 months)</h2>
							<h3>Česká Pojišťovna a.s. | Prague, CZ | www.ceskapojistovna.cz</h3>
					 <p class="freeBottom">
						 	Without prior experience in data analytics, I became a data analyst. My daily tasks included data warehousing, analytics and reporting as per the needs of the BI team. I had the opportunity to work on several bigger projects, one of which was a report for the Czech Central Bank and rectifying errors in automated scripts. It was a great experience and I am now confident in my SQL and Excel skills.

	    				<h2 class="">2015 Web and Development Intern (9 months)</h2>
							<h3>Swoop Antarctica Ltd. | Bristol, UK | www.swoop-antarctica.com</h3>
                <p>What initially started as a 140h internship grew into a 9-month long contract. I spent first six months working in Bristol, UK with occasional work from home, but worked remotely from Prague, CZ during the last three months of the job.</p>
								<p>
									I  had full responsibility over the company's main asset - the website. Besides keeping an eye on the website (updates, fixing errors etc.), I worked closely with the marketing team, company directors and developers to work on constant improvements of the user experience in the form of short-term projects I was responsible for. Overall, this experience helped me to learn or improve skills in the following areas: team-working, communication, reporting, project and time management, remote working.
								</p>
								<p class="freeBottom">
									Furthermore, I was lucky to witness a complete rebranding of the company, from start to finish, which was an incredible lesson for a Management student.

	    				<h2>2015 Bike Mechanic (2 months)</h2>
							<h3>CabTech s.r.o. | Prague, CZ | www.cabtech.cz</h3>
                <p class="freeBottom">
                Working with Pavel Cabelicky, one of the best mechanics in the country, was an excellent school in learning the best customs in bike care. I spent time in his workshop during the week and serviced bikes at mountain bike races during the weekend.
                </p>


							<h2>2015 Bike Mechanic (2 months)</h2>
							<h3>SP Kolo s.r.o. | Prague, CZ | www.spkolo.cz</h3>
                <p class="freeBottom">
                I spent the 2015 summer working as a mechanic in a Specialized Concept Store in Prague - SP Kolo. I acquired essential skills in bike servicing and care. I also helped our customers in store, as both a salesman and technician - I was the only one who was able to help international customers.
                </p>

      				<h2>2014 Corporate Finance Intern (1 month)</h2>
							<h3>Česká Spořitelna a.s. | Prague, CZ | www.csas.cz</h3>
              	<p class="freeBottom">
                My internship in the Corporate Finance department was a great opportunity to get insights on the operations within the department and on financial instruments used in commerce. I spent my days with different mentors everyday, who showed me their job and gave me some tasks to do. I believe that this experience was a brilliant complement to my studies because I was able to compare and contrast theory taught at University with practice.
                </p>

								<h2 >2013 Superhost (5 years)</h2>
								<h3>Airbnb Inc. | Prague, CZ | www.airbnb.cz</h3>
                <p class="freeBottom">I find it fun to discover new places and thanks to Airbnb, traveling has become even easier for me. Renting your place when you don't use it is a great way of earning some extra cash I use towards travel. It is a great thing to do alongside my studies and an opportunity to meet a lot of inspiring people. This experience has been an invaluable lesson in communications, organisation, customer care and property management. Our guests satisfaction with the job I do is demostrated by their high rating in the form of the superhost badge. <a class="more" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1121510"> Learn more.</a></p>

								<h2>2010 Economic & Strategic Development Intern (1 month)</h2>
								<h3>Česká Spořitelna a.s. | Prague, CZ | www.csas.cz</h3>
								<p class="freeBottom">
								This was a mandatory internship while at Lycée Français de Prague and was a great introduction to future career prospects. I spent my days with different mentors and analysts from the research department of Ceska Sporitelna, which was an invaluable experience.
