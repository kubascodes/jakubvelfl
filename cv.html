            <h1>About me</h1>
    <p id="scroll">After graduating from the University of Bristol, I packed my backpack to spend the next year (2016-17) travelling and make my dream come true. I'm a lifelong optimist and take every day as an opportunity to try something new, do something exciting. Life is short, our most valuable possession is time! I have a strong passion for travelling and absolutely love being outdoors... You'll probably find me mountain biking or running in the hills, wild camping in the woods or doing some remote trekking. When I'm at home (not often), my hobbies also include occasional cooking, coding the web or anything technical (fixing the bike, car or building something like my speakers). I am a social person always open to a good pint of czech beer.</p>

            <h1>Education</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>University of Bristol (2013-16)</h2>
    <p>I obtained my BSc. Management degree with 2.1 class honours from the University of Bristol in June 2016. I studied the fields of Economics (Macroeconomics, Intermediate Microeconomics), Statistics and Econometrics (QM1, QM2, QM3), Accounting (Intermediate Financial Accounting, Advanced Management Accounting), Finance (Advanced Corporate Finance) and Management Science (Advanced level). <a class="more" href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2016/management/bsc-management/">Learn more.</a> On top of my studies, I participated work-related workshops, Basecamp startup competition sponsored by University of Bristol where I advanced to final round, conferences and speeches, which all contributed to my Bristol PLUS award that recognizes beyond academic effort of students related to increased employability.</p>
            <h2>Lycee Francais de Prague (2006-13)</h2>
            <p>Previously, I spent my high school years at the Lycée Francais de Prague, where I had the opportunity to learn French, English and Spanish as well as gaining the skill of critical thinking and expressing that in numerous essays. I specialised in economics and mathematics. In 2013, I received the French Baccalaureate with an overall average of 16,77/20 and the best possible "tres bien" diploma class.<a class="more" href="http://www.lfp.cz/lang.php?lang=en">Learn more.</a> </p>
            <h2>Liberty Christian School USA (2010-11)</h2>
            <p>I also took part in a one year long exchange student programme at a US high school. This was a great opportunity to perfect my English skills, learn about a different culture and become independent. I took chemistry, mathematics, english and spanish classes here. Furthermore, I was required to complete french and french history/geography classes at an online French Academy CNED, which made it possible for me to continue studying with my classmates upon coming back to Czech Republic.<a class="more" href="http://www.libertychristian.net/">Learn more.</a></p>
            <h2>Codecademy, Coursera and Udacity</h2>
            <p>Alongside my degree, I also take some online classes via those websites. I find it interesting to extend the scope of my knowledge beyond the scope of my course. I learned to code the web (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and took courses related to Data Science and Data Mining, which greatly supplemented my knowledge of statistics and econometrics. <a class="more" href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/5c01e31086537834a12a975ea2a9e4f0"> Learn more.</a></p>

	    <h2 class="left">Airbnb superhost (2013-now)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">I find it fun to discover new places and thanks to Airbnb, travelling has become even easier for me. Renting your place when you don't use it is a great way of earning some extra cash I use towards travel. It is a great thing to do alongside my studies and an opportunity to meet a lot of inspiring people. This experience has been an invaluable lesson in communications, organisation, customer care and property management. Our guests satisfaction with the job I do is demostrated by their high rating in the form of the superhost badge. <a class="more" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1121510"> Learn more.</a></p>
                
                   <h2 class="left">Volunteer at Shambhala Festival 2017</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">Halfway through my bike trip across BC, Canada, I decided to take a break and volunteer at Secret Solstice. I met wonderful people, got to know some new musicians and overall experienced fun 5 days here.</p> 
                
            <h2 class="left">Volunteering through Workaway (2016-2017)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">Workaway is a great way to access interesting volunteering projects around the world, learn something new and understand the local culture. This is exactly what it did for me, I learned some new skills mainly in building (working with drywall, refurbishing windows) alongside the benefits of saving money while travelling. Furthermore, we really met great people during workaway and I kept in touch with most of them.</p>
	    
	    <h2 class="left">Web and Development Intern at Swoop Travel (12/2015-09/2016)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">What initially started as a 140h internship grew into a 9-month long contract. I spent first six months working in Bristol, UK with occasional work from home, but worked remotely from Prague, CZ during the last three months of the job. I had full responsibility over the company's main asset - the website. Besides keeping an eye on the website (updates, fixing errors etc.), I worked closely with the marketing team, company directors and developers to constantly work on improving the user experience in the form of some short-term projects I was responsible for. However, what was even more interesting was to witness of the full rebranding of the company, from start to finish, it was an incredible lesson for a student of Management. Overall, this experience helped me to learn or improve skills in the following areas: team-working, communication, reporting, project and time management, remote working.</p>
            
	    <h2 class="left">Volunteer at Secret Solstice Festival 2016</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">This was the first time I signed up for volunteering at a festival. It was really great, I met amazing people with whom I remained in touch and experienced wonderful ending to my Icelandic trip when I got to listen to some of my most favourite bands (GusGus). I also learned in a shock how much trash is produced at festivals.</p>    
            
	     <h2>Bike Mechanic / Pavel Cabelicky (2015)</h2>
                    <p class="freeBottom">
                Working with Pavel Cabelicky, one of the best mechanics in the country, was an excellent school in learning the best customs in bike care. I spent some time in his workshop and even got to service bikes at a race.
                </p>
                <h2>Bike Mechanic at SP Kolo (2015)</h2>
                    <p class="freeBottom">
                I spent the 2015 summer working as a mechanic in a Specialized Concept Store in Prague - SP Kolo. I acquired essential skills in bike servicing and care as well as had the opportunity to help customers in store.
                </p>
                          
            <h2>Two 1-month long internships at Ceska Sporitelna (2014, 2010)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">
                I took two internships at the Ceska Sporitelna bank. One as an intern in the Corporate Finance department and the other in the Strategic and Economic Research. Those internships were a great opportunity of getting insights on how banks operate and what each job consists of. I spent my days with different mentors everyday, who showed me their job and gave me some tasks to do. I believe that this experience was a brilliant complement to my studies because I was able to compare and contrast theory taught at University with how things are carried out in practice.

                <p class="freeBottom">I benefit from knowing 3 languages fluently: Czech, French and English. Furthermore, I have reasonable knowledge of Spanish (now perfected in South America to B1) and have just started with German. Languages are essential in today's hyperconnected world and I believe I have strong communication skills.
</p>
            <h2>Informatics</h2>
                <p>I can do a lot of stuff on the computer both Mac and Windows:</p>
                <div class="moreBorders">
                <li>Microsoft Office and iLife on Mac (including Excel)</li>
                <li>Intermediate HTML and CSS; basic Javascript, Jquery, PHP and Mysql</li>
                <li>Intermediate use of graphic/photo software: Graphic (vector drawing tool for Mac), Google Sketchup, Photoshop</li>
                <li>Management modeling using Simul8, Microsoft Project</li>
                <li>Video editing using iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere</li>

            <h2>Skills in finance, data analysis</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">I am also capable of doing some data analysis, prepare & analyse financial statements, understand finance & construct the optimal investment portfolio (excel), model & run a simulation of a real world problem (simul8) and have some transferrable economics skills. 
</p>
            <h2>Bikes..</h2>

            <br>
            <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about sports in general. I can name a few of my favorite activities: running and trail running, cross-country skiing, hiking and mountain biking are definitely my top favourite. I spent some time in a high school cross country and track running team, which was great fun. I was also part of a road bike racing team, where I greatly improved on my technique and performance. When I was younger, I tried my luck in tennis and golfing, but it was not for me.
</p>
            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>I like to discover new places, get lost occasionally or wander. That's why I love mountain biking and hiking because you can travel on your own, being dependent solely on yourself. I have been to quite a lot of places. To name a few: sailing in the Carribean, safari in Kenya, hiking in Iceland, Ukraine, most of South America, Cuba, Nepal, India... I take a lot of pictures & videos each time I travel, which I plan to make available on this web.
</p>
            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>I have always been interested in everything 'technical'. The world is getting more and more computerized and I don't want to be illiterate in this sense. In 2013 while starting University, I set myself to start learning how to code on a computer. I find it really fun because you can see results immediately (this web for example). I focused on learning Python first, then switching to basic HTML, CSS. Working my way, I extended my knowledge to Javascript,Jquery,Php and databases. I believe that I have a fair knowledge of HTML and CSS but still need to work on Java & Php. I think of coding as another language to know, to be used in communication with computers.
</p>
            <h2>DIY Projects</h2>
            <p>
             In my spare time, I focus on doing some DIY projects. So far, I was quite successful. My first project was building a pair of speakers - that went great and I am very happy with the sound and build quality as I've had them for over 8 years now. Second, I built a boombox for my brother for his birthday, which was a little more complicated as to the design stage (box construction and engineering the internal parts), but that also went well and the speakers work like charm! There are many other hobbyist projects I do around the house as well as fixing of broken stuff (electronics, motorcycle, car..).
</p>
            <h2>Camera</h2>
            <p>
             I document most of my trips on a camera and produce occasional short films from these.
