            <h1>About me</h1>
    <p id="scroll">After graduating from the University of Bristol, I packed my backpack to spend the next year (2016-17) travelling and make my dream come true. I enjoy doing and learning about new things as a means of self-development. I have passion for travelling, being outdoors, especially mountain biking and running. My hobbies also include occasional cooking and programming. I am a social person always open to a good pint of czech beer.

            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>University of Bristol (2013-16)</h2>
    <p>I obtained my BSc. Management degree with 2.1 class honours from the University of Bristol in June 2016. I studied the fields of Economics, Statistics, Accounting, Finance and Management. <a class="more" href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2016/management/bsc-management/">Learn more.</a></p>
            <h2>Lycee Francais de Prague (2006-13)</h2>
            <p>Previously, I spent my high school years at the Lycée Francais de Prague, where I had the opportunity to learn French, English and Spanish as well as gaining the skill of critical thinking and expressing that in numerous essays. <a class="more" href="http://www.lfp.cz/lang.php?lang=en">Learn more.</a> </p>
            <h2>Liberty Christian School USA (2010-11)</h2>
            <p>I also took part in a one year long exchange student programme at a US high school. This was a great opportunity to perfect my English skills, learn about a different culture and become independent. <a class="more" href="http://www.libertychristian.net/">Learn more.</a></p>
            <h2>Codecademy, Coursera and Udacity</h2>
            <p>Alongside my degree, I also take some online classes via those websites. I find it interesting to extend the scope of my knowledge beyond my course.<a class="more" href="https://www.coursera.org/user/i/5c01e31086537834a12a975ea2a9e4f0"> Learn more.</a></p>

	    <h2 class="left">Airbnb host (2013-now)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">I find it fun to discover new places and thanks to Airbnb, travelling has become even easier for me. Renting your place when you don't use it is a great way of earning the extra cash I use towards travel. It is a great thing to do alongside my studies and an opportunity to meet a lot of inspiring people. This is a invaluable lesson in communications, organisation and taking care of a property. <a class="more" href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1121510"> Learn more.</a></p>
                   
            <h2 class="left">Volunteering through Workaway (2016-now)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">Workaway is a great way to access interesting volunteering projects around the world, learn something new and understand the local culture. This is exactly what it did for me, I learned some new skills mainly in building (working with drywall, refurbishing windows) alongside the benefits of saving money while travelling.</p
	    
	    <h2 class="left">Web and Development Intern at Swoop Travel (12/2015-09/2016)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">What initially started as a 140h internship grew into a 9-month long contract. I had full responsibility over the company's main asset - their website and also worked on some smaller projects. This experience helped me to learn or improve skills in the following areas: team-working, communication, reporting, project and time management, remote working.</p>
            
	    <h2 class="left"Volunteer at Secret Solstice Festival 2016</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">This was the first time I signed up for volunteering at a festival. It was really great, I met amazing people with whom I remained in touch and experienced wonderful ending to my Icelandic trip when I got to listen to some of my most favourite bands (GusGus). I also learned in a shock how much trash was produced at the festival.</p>    
            
	     <h2>Bike Mechanic / Pavel Cabelicky (2015)</h2>
                    <p class="freeBottom">
                Working with Pavel Cabelicky, one of the best mechanics in the country, was an excellent school in learning the best customs in bike care. I spent some time in his workshop and even got to service bikes at a race.
                </p>
                <h2>Bike Mechanic at SP Kolo (2015)</h2>
                    <p class="freeBottom">
                I spent the 2015 summer working as a mechanic in a Specialized Concept Store in Prague - SP Kolo. I acquired essential skills in bike servicing and care as well as had the opportunity to help customers in store.
                </p>
                          
            <h2>Two 1-month long internships at Ceska Sporitelna (2014, 2010)</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">
                I took two internships at the Ceska Sporitelna bank. One as an intern in the Corporate Finance department and the other in the Strategic and Economic Research. Those internships were a great opportunity of getting insights of how banks operate. I believe that this experience was a brilliant complement to my studies because I was able to compare and contrast theory taught at University with how things are carried out in practice.

            <h2>Languages</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">I benefit from knowing 3 languages fluently: Czech, French and English. Furthermore, I have reasonable knowledge of Spanish (now perfected in South America to B1) and have just started with German. I have strong communication skills through my experience with managing smaller scale projects.
</p>
            <h2>Informatics</h2>
                <p>I can do a lot of stuff on the computer both Mac and Windows:</p>
                <div class="moreBorders">
                <li>Microsoft Office and iLife on Mac</li>
                <li>HTML, CSS, basic Javascript, PHP and Mysql</li>
                <li>Graphic (vector drawing tool for Mac), Google Sketchup</li>
                <li>Simul8, Microsoft Project</li>
                <li>iMovie, Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere</li>

            <h2>Skills in finance, data analysis</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">I am also capable of doing some data analysis, prepare & analyse financial statements, understand finance & construct the optimal investment portfolio, model & run a simulation of a real world problem and have some transferrable economics skills. 
</p>
            <h2>Bikes..</h2>
                <p class="freeBottom">I know how to take care of and service bikes. My philosophy is to take good care of the bicycle in order to prevent any breakdowns. This saves time and money.

            <br>
            <h2>Sports</h2>
    <p>I am passionate about sports in general. I can name a few of my favorite activities: running, cross-country skiing, hiking and mountain biking are definitely my top. I spent some time in a high school cross country and track running team, which was great fun. Another year was spent in a road bike racing team, where I improved on my technique and performance. 
</p>
            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>I like to discover new places, get lost occasionally or wander. That's why I love mountain biking and hiking because you can travel on your own, being dependent solely on yourself. I have been to quite a few spots including the Carribean, Kenya, Iceland, Ukraine or the US to name some. I take a lot of pictures & videos each time I travel, which I plan to make available on this web.
</p>
            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>I have always been interested in everything 'technical'. The world is getting more and more computerized and I don't want to be illiterate in this sense. In 2013 while starting University, I set myself to start learning how to code on a computer. I find it really fun because you can see results immediately (this web for example). I focused on learning Python first, then switching to basic HTML, CSS. Working my way, I extended my knowledge to Javascript,Jquery,Php and databases. I believe that I have a fair knowledge of HTML and CSS but still need some work on Java & Php. I think of programming as a way of expressing my creativity.
</p>
            <h2>DIY Projects</h2>
            <p>
             In my spare time, I focus on doing some DIY projects. So far, I was quite successful. My first project was building a pair of speakers - that went great and I am very happy with the sound. Second, I built a boombox for my brother for his birthday, which was a little more complicated as to the design of the box and fitting the electronics in but it also went well and it works like charm!   
</p>
            <h2>Camera</h2>
            <p>
             I document most of my trips on a camera and produce occasional short films from these.
