					<h3><i>I strive to improve what can be done better to create a positive impact in the world.</i>
					</h3>

					<h2>BIO</h2>
					<p>I am a multi-talented person with a cross-disciplinary background. Instead of specialising in one
						field, I like variety, seeing the big picture and thinking beyond the box.</p>
					<p>I studied languages, mathematics, business and later informatics. On top of that, I self-learned programming with a dream of becoming a web developer. Similarly, I put my nose into mechanics
						and electrics to learn how to fix bikes and to get that old bus back on the road. As I am deeply concerned by climate change, I continue to broaden my knowledge of topics around nature - sustainability -
						alternative socioeconomic systems. Last but not least, I nurture my creative side with strong interests in art - design -
						architecture. I believe learning is a continuous journey.</p>

					<h2>SKILLS</h2>
					<p>We put a lot of labels on people in an attempt to capture their essence. And in trying to say who we are, we sometimes try to fit into a narrow definition of what it means to be [human]. Hmmmm, but what exactly do I mean?</p>
					<p>To me, there are lots of "I am" that capture a part of me and then there are some things that "I like to" do. At times, I am the geek behind the computer screen, coding, wrangling data to useful information and bringing those fresh ideas to life. At other times, I enjoy talking to people to research interesting insights that turn into knowledge. I also find pleasure in fixing broken things, the journey of figuring out what's wrong and finding a good solution is quite fulfilling... it's also a lifesafer when something goes wrong down the road! And when the right season comes around, I harvest fruits and brew refreshments that quench thirst, give energy and put a smile on people's faces.</p>
					<p>But hey, there is more to my story - living life is not a constant, it's rather constantly unfolding.</p>
					<p>I'm a mountain biker, traveller, backpacker, hitchhiker who is driven by the curiosity to discover what's behind the horizon. Within these activities, I rejoice over being outdoors, deepening my connection with the natural world and my inner self within the concept of disconnect to reconnect.</p>
					<p>I like working with my hands, I like to exercise my brain and stretch my body beyond the zone of comfort to keep on trying new
						things. Growing and growing, taking small steps that lead to big things... Climbing has proved to be good way to face my fear of heights - hanging up there on the rope, trusting yourself and your partner with life. Slackline helps to find balance between the body and the mind - you fall when you're not aligned. And surfing is so much more than playing that role model of being a surfer - it teaches me to wait patiently for the right wave through careful observation of the ocean - when it comes you're on natural high oh yeah!</p>
					<p>And then there is the world of sounds, writing, analog photography, art... I love playing the piano, recording natural soundscapes - it feels like being a sonic explorer. I like to express myself in a creative way. I like to be inspired by the world around me and to inspire others.</p>
					<p>While distinct and seemingly unrelated, each of these "I am" and "I like to" experiences contributes tremendously
						towards my personal development, know-how and a balanced skillset overall.</p>

					<h2>CODE</h2>
					<p>I think of technology as a helpful tool that extends human capabilities. Thereby, I work on tech
						tools that help and connect people, solve challenges and unlock new possibilities.</p>
					<p>My favourite programming language is Javascript along with the following tech stack Mongo | Express | React | Node.js | Typescript | GraphQL | MaterialUI
						| Git | Docker | Digital Ocean.</p>
					<p>With the help of these technologies, I develop web apps that run in the cloud. My strengths lie particularly in backend systems and databases, at the same time I cover the full-stack from system design, through
						implementation to maintenance.</p>

					<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
					<p>Research insights help us to understand the world around us through knowledge discovery. From
						research design, through data collection, to structured information and knowledge, I can do it.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Bachelor Thesis</i></b> How does sharing economy impact traditional organisations <a
								href="assets/jakub velfl - how does sharing economy impact traditional organisations.pdf">(pdf)</a>
						</li>
						<li><b><i>Master Thesis</b></i> Why do WEEE need monitoring: towards documented e-waste
							management in Ghana. designing a system for monitoring resource flows <a
								href="mailto:hello@jakubv.com">(ask for copy)</a>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>DATA</h2>
					<p>Data points to knowledge. But not that fast... I have extensive experience with modelling, warehousing,
						manipulating, analysing, reporting and visualisation of data using MongoDb, SQL (MySQL and
						PostgreSQL), R and Excel. </p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="/assets/spotify.html">Spotify Best Of 2017</a> - data analysis</li>
