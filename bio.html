					<h3><i>I strive to improve what can be done better to create a positive impact in the world.</i>
					</h3>

					<h2>INTRO</h2>

					<p>I am a multi-talented person with a cross-disciplinary background. Instead of specialising in one
						field, I like variety, thinking beyond the box to see the big picture.</p>

					<p>I studied languages, mathematics, business and later informatics. On top of that, I self-learned
						programming with a dream of becoming a web developer. Similarly, I put my nose into mechanics
						and electrics to learn how to fix bikes and to get my old bus back on the road. As I
						am deeply
						concerned by the environmental crisis, I continue to broaden my knowledge of topics around
						nature - sustainability - alternative socioeconomic systems.
						Last but not least, I nurture my creative side with strong
						interests in art — design — architecture.
						I believe learning is a continuous journey.</p>

					<h2>BEING A HUMAN BEING</h2>

					<p>We use a lot of labels in an attempt to capture our essence. We introduce ourselves by our name,
						profession, age, nationality... In trying to say who
						we are, we try to fit into a narrow definition of what it means to be [human]. I invite you to
						think beyond labels and definitions... Okay, but what exactly do I mean by that?</p>

					<p>To me, there are lots of "I am" that capture a part of me and then there are things that "I
						like to" do.</p>

					<p>At times, I am the geek behind the computer screen, coding and wrangling data to
						useful information, bringing innovative ideas to life. Likewise, I enjoy talking to people,
						thinking, reading, connecting interesting information to insights that lead to the discovery of
						new knowledge.</p>

					<p>I also find pleasure in fixing broken things, it's quite fulfilling to figure out
						what's wrong, putting my skills and knowledge on the table to find a good solution that
						hopefully
						... works! Being able to repair things is also a lifesafer when something goes wrong down the
						road, not mentioning it's better than buying new!</p>

					<p>But hey, there is more to my story - life is not a constant, it's a story that is
						constantly unfolding through everyday living.</p>

					<p>I'm a mountain biker, traveller, backpacker, hitchhiker driven by curiosity and
						discovery. I wonder what is behind the horizon. And then I go. Within these activities,
						I rejoice over being outdoors, deepening my connection with the natural world and my inner self
						through reflections.
						I call it disconnect to reconnect.</p>

					<p>I like ... quite a lot of things! I like working with my hands, I like to exercise my brain and
						stretch my body beyond the zone of comfort to keep on trying new things.
						Taking small steps that lead to big things, growing and growing...
						I started climbing to face my fear of heights - hanging up on the rope, trusting myself and
						my climbing partner with life. Life is often about balance - slacklining helps me to find
						balance between the body and the mind - you fall when you're not in equilibrium.
						And then there's surfing - the secret to which is much deeper than what's obvious
						on the surface. Surfing teaches me to wait patiently for the right wave through careful
						observation of the ocean - yeah you know when it's coming ... paddle, push, stand up ...
						and you're riding on natural high, oh yeah!</p>

					<p>Then there is the world of sounds, writing, little projects here and there, analog
						photography... I love playing the piano, recording natural soundscapes - feeling like a
						sonic explorer through outer worlds. I like to express myself
						in a creative way, inspired by the world around me and hopefully inspire others myself.</p>

					<p>And of course, when the right season comes around, I harvest fruits and brew refreshments that quench
						thirst, replenish energy and put a smile on people's faces.</p>

					<p>While distinct and seemingly unrelated, each of these "I am" and "I like to" experiences
						contributes tremendously
						towards my personal development, know-how and a balanced skillset overall.</p>

					<h2>CODE</h2>

					<p>I think of technology as a helpful tool that extends human capabilities. Thereby, I work on tech
						tools that help and connect people, solve challenges and unlock new possibilities.</p>

					<p>My favourite programming language is Javascript along with the following tech stack Mongo |
						Express | React | Node.js | Typescript | GraphQL | MaterialUI
						| Git | Docker | Digital Ocean.</p>

					<p>With the help of these technologies, I develop web apps that run in the cloud. My strengths lie
						particularly in backend systems and databases. However, I cover the full-stack from
						system design, through
						implementation to maintenance.</p>

					<h2>RESEARCH</h2>

					<p>Research insights help us to understand the world around us through knowledge discovery. From
						research design, through data collection, to structured information and knowledge, I can do it.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Bachelor Thesis</i></b> How does sharing economy impact traditional organisations <a
								href="assets/jakub velfl - how does sharing economy impact traditional organisations.pdf">(pdf)</a>
						</li>
						<li><b><i>Master Thesis</b></i> Why do WEEE need monitoring: towards documented e-waste
							management in Ghana. designing a system for monitoring resource flows <a
								href="mailto:hello@jakubv.com">(ask for copy)</a>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>DATA</h2>

					<p>Data points to knowledge. But not that fast... I have extensive experience with modelling,
						warehousing,
						manipulating, analysing, reporting and visualisation of data using MongoDb, SQL (MySQL and
						PostgreSQL), R and Excel. </p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="/assets/spotify.html">Spotify Best Of 2017</a> - data analysis</li>
